This is a  program  which was designed as part of my "30-Day Python Challenge." 

1. Constant
   - NOTES_FILE: The name of the file where our notes will store.

2. Functions
   - show_menu(): Displays the menu options for the user.
   - add_note(): Asks the user to enter a note and appends it to the notes.txt file. It handles any exceptions that might occur 
     during file operations.
   - view_notes(): This function reads all notes from the file and displays them. If the file doesn't exist, it catches the FileNotFoundError.
   - update_note(): This function allows the user to update a specific note based on its index number. It reads all notes, displays them, and asks for the 
     index number of the note to update. It then overwrites the note with updated content.
   - delete_note(): Similar to update_note(), but it deletes a selected note instead of updating it.
   - show_cursor_position(): Opens the file in read mode and prints the current cursor position in bytes using tell(). If the file 
     doesn't exist, it catches the FileNotFoundError.
   - read_from_position(): Asks the user for a byte position and uses seek() to move the cursor to that position in the file, then 
     reads and displays the content from that point onwards. It handles various exceptions such as invalid input or file not found.

3. main()
   - The main() function displays the menu and processes user input in a while loop until the user chooses to exit (option 7). Each choice 
     corresponds to a function that performs the desired operation.


What I've learnt:
  - seek(position): Moves the cursor to a specified byte position in the file.
  - tell(): Returns the current byte position of the cursor in the file.
